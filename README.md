### Overview
ReLocalizeBug Fix was created to resolve localization issues in Half-Life dedicated servers. However, with the updates and advancements in the ReHLDS engine, this plugin is now deprecated and not compatible with current ReHLDS builds. Initially developed as an extension of [LocalizeBugFix by s1lentq](https://github.com/s1lentq/localizebugfix) for HLDS, it aimed to fix localization-related bugs in the server environment but is no longer maintained.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This project has been [deprecated since 2017](https://github.com/rehlds/rehlds/issues/328#issuecomment-275837883).

### Warning
Using this plugin with newer versions of ReHLDS may lead to instability and unexpected behavior. We recommend utilizing supported plugins and features available in the latest releases.
